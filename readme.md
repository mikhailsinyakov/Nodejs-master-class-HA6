# Hello World API
## Homework Assignment #6 [(Node.js master class)](https://pirple.thinkific.com)
---

This is a simple JSON API that listens on port 400.

This API uses all the CPUs on your system to process requests.

When you posts anything to the route '/hello', the server returns a welcome message in JSON format.

When you posts anything to any other route, the server returns a not found message in JSON format.

In order to use my API you need to:
- clone this repository to the selected folder:
 ~~~
git clone https://github.com/mikhailsinyakov/Nodejs-master-class-HA6.git
 ~~~
- run node command:
~~~
node index.js
~~~
